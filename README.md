# TCSP-simulation
 Monte Carlo simulation for faithful representation of Time Correlated Single Photon counting experiments  
 
 dependencies: pandas scipy seaborn matplotlib + numpy  
 
 Final plots are made in Jupyter notebook  
 
 To run change the "path" in scripts/MonteCarlo.py to your path of the files. 
 
main functionality:
1. generate mono exponential decays using the Monte Carlo method and 
2.various plotting methods including phasor plots
