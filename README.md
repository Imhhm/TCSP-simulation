# TCSP-simulation
 Monte Carlo simulation for faithful representation of Time Correlated Single Photon counting experiments made for KURF internship in the Physics department of King's College London.
 
 
 dependencies: pandas scipy seaborn matplotlib + numpy  
 
 Final plots are made in Jupyter notebook  
 
 To run change the "path" in scripts/MonteCarlo.py to your path of the files. 
 
main functionality:

1. generate mono exponential decays using the Monte Carlo method 

2. various plotting methods including phasor plots
